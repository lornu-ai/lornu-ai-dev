# Planning Guide

A modern, tech-forward web application that showcases innovation through elegant design, inspired by flowing circuit board aesthetics and digital transformation.

**Experience Qualities**: 
1. **Fluid & Dynamic** - Smooth transitions and flowing animations mirror the logo's swirling data streams
2. **Technical & Professional** - Clean, precise layouts convey expertise and reliability
3. **Futuristic & Approachable** - Advanced design that remains welcoming and easy to navigate

**Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
  - Multi-section landing page with smooth navigation, interactive elements, and persistent user preferences

## Essential Features

### Hero Section with Animated Elements
- **Functionality**: Eye-catching introduction with company name, tagline, and animated visual elements
- **Purpose**: Immediately communicate brand identity and capture attention
- **Trigger**: Page load
- **Progression**: Logo fade-in → Headline reveal → Subtitle animation → CTA appearance
- **Success criteria**: Users understand the company purpose within 3 seconds

### Services/Features Showcase
- **Functionality**: Display core offerings in interactive cards with hover effects
- **Purpose**: Clearly communicate value propositions
- **Trigger**: Scroll into view or section navigation
- **Progression**: Section enters viewport → Cards stagger-animate in → Hover reveals details
- **Success criteria**: Each service clearly understood, hover interactions feel responsive

### Contact/CTA Section
- **Functionality**: Prominent call-to-action with contact form or connection options
- **Purpose**: Convert interest into engagement
- **Trigger**: User scrolls to bottom or clicks CTA button
- **Progression**: Click CTA → Smooth scroll to contact → Form focus → Submission → Success toast
- **Success criteria**: Form is accessible, validates input, shows clear feedback

### Smooth Navigation
- **Functionality**: Fixed header with smooth scrolling between sections
- **Purpose**: Allow easy exploration of all content
- **Trigger**: Click nav items or scroll naturally
- **Progression**: Click nav item → Smooth scroll animation → Section highlights
- **Success criteria**: Navigation feels instant and orientation is always clear

## Edge Case Handling
- **Empty Form Submission**: Inline validation prevents submission, highlights required fields
- **Slow Network**: Skeleton loaders show content structure immediately
- **Mobile Viewport**: Hamburger menu collapses navigation, cards stack vertically
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full tab order support with visible focus states
- **Rapid Interactions**: Debounced animations prevent stacking

## Design Direction

The design should feel cutting-edge yet trustworthy—like a tech company that's innovative but established. Clean geometric layouts with flowing organic animations create interesting contrast. A minimal interface with strategic use of gradients and glows emphasizes key content without overwhelming.

## Color Selection

Custom palette derived from the logo's technology aesthetic

- **Primary Color**: Deep Navy Blue (oklch(0.25 0.08 240)) - Represents stability, trust, and technical depth; used for headers, primary text, and key structural elements
- **Secondary Colors**: 
  - Teal/Cyan (oklch(0.70 0.12 195)) - Dynamic energy and innovation; used for interactive elements and accents
  - Dark Teal (oklch(0.45 0.10 200)) - Supporting color for cards and secondary elements
- **Accent Color**: Lime/Chartreuse (oklch(0.85 0.15 130)) - High-tech highlight for CTAs and important interactive elements
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (Light Gray oklch(0.97 0 0)): Navy Blue text (oklch(0.25 0.08 240)) - Ratio 8.9:1 ✓
  - Card (White oklch(1 0 0)): Navy Blue text (oklch(0.25 0.08 240)) - Ratio 10.5:1 ✓
  - Primary Navy (oklch(0.25 0.08 240)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 10.5:1 ✓
  - Secondary Teal (oklch(0.45 0.10 200)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 5.2:1 ✓
  - Accent Lime (oklch(0.85 0.15 130)): Navy text (oklch(0.25 0.08 240)) - Ratio 7.8:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Typography should feel modern and technical yet highly readable, conveying precision and forward-thinking.

- **Primary Font**: Inter - Clean geometric sans-serif perfect for tech brands
- **Accent Font**: JetBrains Mono (for code snippets or technical details) - Reinforces technical credibility

- **Typographic Hierarchy**: 
  - H1 (Hero Title): Inter Bold/56px/tight letter-spacing/-1px
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter Semibold/36px/tight letter-spacing/-0.5px  
  - H3 (Card Titles): Inter Semibold/24px/normal letter-spacing
  - Body (Primary): Inter Regular/16px/relaxed line-height/1.6
  - Body (Secondary): Inter Regular/14px/muted color
  - CTA Buttons: Inter Semibold/16px/uppercase/wide letter-spacing

## Animations

Motion should feel purposeful and physics-based—like data flowing through circuits. Subtle animations guide attention without distraction, creating a sense of sophisticated technological advancement.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Flowing entrance animations mirror the logo's data streams; hover effects add dimensionality
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Hero elements animate first, then stagger down the page as user scrolls

## Component Selection

- **Components**: 
  - Button (Primary CTAs with gradient hover states)
  - Card (Service/feature displays with hover lift effect)
  - Input, Textarea, Label (Contact form with floating labels)
  - Toast (sonner for form submission feedback)
  - Separator (Section dividers)
  
- **Customizations**: 
  - Custom gradient backgrounds for hero section
  - Custom card hover effects with shadow and transform
  - Custom navigation with blur backdrop
  
- **States**: 
  - Buttons: rest → hover (gradient shift + lift) → active (slight scale down)
  - Cards: rest → hover (lift + glow) → click (navigate or expand)
  - Inputs: empty → focused (border glow) → filled (success state) → error (red border + message)
  
- **Icon Selection**: 
  - @phosphor-icons/react: Lightning for speed, Code for development, Rocket for launch, ChartLine for growth, Users for team, Envelope for contact
  
- **Spacing**: 
  - Section padding: py-20 (lg:py-32)
  - Card gaps: gap-8 (lg:gap-12)
  - Element spacing: space-y-6 for text blocks, space-y-4 for form fields
  
- **Mobile**: 
  - Hero text scales down (text-4xl → text-5xl → text-6xl)
  - Three-column grid becomes single column (grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3)
  - Fixed nav becomes bottom nav or hamburger menu
  - Spacing reduces on mobile (py-12 → py-20)
